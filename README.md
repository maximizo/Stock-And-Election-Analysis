## Project Description

This project is comprised of two smaller projects, which are an analysis of bank data and election data.

## Features & Libraries
* Python

## My Process: 
In the first part of the project, I will write a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I will calculate the following information: 
* Total number of months included in the dataset
* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In the second part of the project, I will write a Python script to analyze the election data from a small, rural town. I will calculate the following information:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
